     <h1>Crown shyness</h1>

    <p><b>Crown shyness</b><i> (also canopy disengagement,[1] canopy shyness,[2]or
    inter-crown spacing[3])</i> is a phenomenon observed in some tree species,
    in which the crowns<br>of fully stocked trees do not touch each other,
    forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.[4][5] The phenomenon is most
    prevalent among trees of the same species,<br>but also occurs between trees
    of different species.[6][7] There exist many hypotheses as to why crown
    shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it <br> might
    inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.[8]</p>

<h4>Possible physiological explanations</h4>

<p> The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is not certain.[6] The
    phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature since the 1920s.[9]
    The variety of<br>hypotheses and experimental results might suggest that 
    there are multiple mechanisms across different species, an example of
    convergent evolution. [citation needed]<br><br> Some hypotheses contend that
    the interdigitation of canopy branches leads to "reciprocal pruning"
    of adjacent trees. trees in windy areas suffer physical damage<br>as they
    collide with each other during winds; the abrasions and collisions induce a
    crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral<br> branch growth is 
    largely uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.
    [10] If the crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the<br> 
    winds,they gradually fill the canopy gaps.[11] This explains instances of 
    crown shyness between branches of the same organism. Proponents of this idea
    cite that<br> shyness is particularly seen in conditions conducive to this
    pruning, including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early
    succession forests where branches<br> are flexible and limited in lateral
    movement.[6][12] According to this theory, variable flexibility in
    lateral branches greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.</p>
