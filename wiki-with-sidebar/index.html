                <img src="images/dl.png" id="dl">
                <p>Dying Light is a 2015 survival horror video game developed by
                    Techland and published by Warner Bros. Interactive
                    Entertainment. The game's story follows undercover agent
                    Kyle Crane who is sent to infiltrate a quarantine zone in
                    a fictional Middle Eastern city called Harran. It
                    features an enemy-infested, open world city with a
                    dynamic day–night cycle, in which zombies are slow and
                    clumsy during daytime and extremely aggressive at 
                    night. The gameplay is focused on weapons-based 
                    combat and parkour, allowing players to choose fight
                    or flight when presented with dangers. The game also
                    features an asymmetrical multiplayer mode
                    (originally set to be a pre-order bonus), and a
                    four-player co-operative multiplayer mode.<br><br>

                    The development of the game began in early 2012, after the
                    team completed the development of Dead Island. The game's
                    parkour system emphasizes natural movement, and David Belle,
                    the pioneer of parkour, was invited to serve as a consultant
                    for the game. To implement that, Techland had to abandon
                    most of the story elements and construct them again from
                    scratch. To create a story that would suit the taste of the
                    American audience, the writing team collaborated with Dan
                    Jolley. The story was inspired by both Heart of Darkness
                    and The Plague. Announced in May 2013, it was released in
                    January 2015 for Linux, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox
                    One. The game was planned to be released on PlayStation 3
                    and Xbox 360, but these versions were cancelled due to
                    hardware limitations.<br><br>
                
                    At release, Dying Light received mixed reviews from critics,
                    with praise mainly directed at the combat, graphics,
                    co-operative multiplayer, navigation and the day–night
                    cycle, while receiving criticism regarding the story,
                    difficulty, and technical issues. The game was a commercial
                    success, breaking the record for first-month sales of a new
                    survival horror intellectual property and selling 20 million
                    units by April 2022. Techland committed to supporting the
                    game, and released downloadable content packs, content drops
                    and free updates for the game several years after the
                    initial launch. An expansion, titled Dying Light: The
                    Following, was released in February 2016. The sequel, Dying
                    Light 2 Stay Human, was released in February 2022. A
                    standalone game titled Dying Light: The Beast, which follows
                    Kyle Crane thirteen years after the events of the original
                    game, will be released in mid 2025.<br><br>

                    Dying Light is a survival horror video game played from a
                    first-person perspective. The game is set in an open world
                    environment called Harran; initially, an area named the
                    Slums can be freely explored, later adding a second area,
                    accessible via sewers, called Old Town.[1] Players traverse
                    this urban environment, which is overrun by zombies. There
                    is an emphasis on parkour mechanics, which allow players to
                    perform actions such as climbing ledges, leaping from edges,
                    sliding, jumping between roofs and zip-lining.[2] A
                    grappling hook allows players to climb up buildings and
                    quickly travel between places.[3] As players explore the
                    game's world, they can scavenge supplies and loot, which
                    can be used to craft new weapons or sold to vendors. The
                    player character can utilise his "survivor sense" to
                    identify all nearby loot and use lock picks to open locked
                    chests and locked vehicles. Players can also complete
                    various side missions by accepting tasks issued by the
                    non-playable characters in the game's safe zones.[4] As
                    players explore Harran, they can also pick up various
                    collectibles such as notes and journals, and listen to voice
                    mail recordings.[5]<br><br>

                    Dying Light contains a dynamic day–night cycle. During the
                    day, players can set traps, save random survivors, and make
                    their way to airdrops. The infected are slow, apathetic, and
                    easily visible and they can be easily avoided.[6] Players
                    can use environmental traps, such as spikes, electrified 
                    fences, and gas tanks, to kill the infected.[7][8] At night,
                    the infected transform to become much more dangerous. 
                    Without daylight, the senses of the infected become more 
                    acute and accurate. They can sprint after the player 
                    character, inflict more damage, and gain the ability to 
                    jump and climb buildings. For players to avoid contact, 
                    they need to use their "survivor sense" to locate and avoid 
                    the infected.[9] If the player character is spotted, they 
                    can use distractions and traps to reduce the number of 
                    infected. Players' main defence against the infected is 
                    ultraviolet light, which slows their movement.[10] At 
                    safehouses, players can adjust the time of day, skipping 
                    night altogether if the player does not feel ready.[4]
                    <br><br>

                    The game features a variety of enemies, including the slow, 
                    low-level Biters, Bombers which explode when the player 
                    character gets too close, Virals which can run quickly, 
                    and dangerous Volatiles which only appear at night.[11] 
                    The majority of the game's combat utilises melee weapons, 
                    with more than 100 weapons and over 1500 weapon 
                    possibilities through crafting and customisation.[12] The 
                    melee weapons have a limited lifespan and will become 
                    degraded and broken if players use them in combat for a 
                    long time. Players can repair a weapon a limited number of 
                    times or dismantle it for parts. Crafting weapons requires 
                    crafting ingredients, such as gauze and metal parts, and a 
                    blueprint, which can be scavenged or purchased from a shop.
                    [4] In the second half of the game, players can use ranged 
                    firearms: two types of assault rifles and a variety of 
                    small firearms and shotguns. Firearms do not break or 
                    degrade, but ammunition is generally scarce and the sound 
                    from them will attract enemies.[4] Weapons are categorised 
                    into different rarities, which are indicated by a weapon's 
                    colour.[11] Players can utilise other items such as 
                    firecrackers, which distract enemies, and explosives like 
                    molotov cocktails, to aid combat.[4] In addition, parkour 
                    mechanics are integrated with combat.[13]<br><br>

                    The player character's combat efficiency is governed by his 
                    health, fitness and stamina. When players take damage, he 
                    will lose health, which can be replenished when Crane 
                    utilises a medkit or consumes food.[11] Fitness governs his 
                    free running endurance, while stamina focuses on how fast 
                    Crane becomes tired in combat.[14] A variety of actions in 
                    Dying Light can help players to earn experience points. 
                    Engaging in combat with enemies will help players to earn 
                    power points, while performing parkour movement can earn 
                    agility points. Completing missions, challenges, and quests 
                    will help players to earn survival points. As players earn 
                    experience, they can spend skill points to select new 
                    skills from a skill tree. Experience points are boosted 
                    when players explore at night, and while survival points 
                    are deducted if killed during the day, there is no such 
                    penalty at night.[4][8]<br><br>

                    The game features a four-player cooperative multiplayer mode 
                    which allows players to explore Harran and complete the 
                    campaign together.[15] Players can complete cooperative 
                    challenges for experience, such as fighting to kill as many 
                    infected as possible and racing against each other to an 
                    airdrop.[16] A multiplayer feature included is a game mode 
                    known as "Be the Zombie" that allows the player to play as a 
                    particularly strong and fast infected mutant called the 
                    "Night Hunter" and invade other players' servers. The 
                    players who are playing as humans are tasked with destroying 
                    the infected nests and surviving attacks performed by the 
                    Night Hunter, while the Night Hunter's goal is to deplete 
                    the players' collective life pool and therefore prevent them 
                    from attacking the nests.[17]
